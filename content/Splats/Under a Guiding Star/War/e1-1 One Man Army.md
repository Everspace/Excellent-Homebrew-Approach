When near a battlegroup, the sidereal may join with it and replace the average stats of the group with the stats of herself. The the sidereal is considered within the battlegroup and may not move away from it without breaking the charm's effects. She and the battlegroup continue to operate independantly.

However, the damage directed at the battlegroup is first inflicted on the Sidereal, unless she chooses to break the benefits of the charm and have it pass into the crowd in her stead.

An essence 3 repurchase allows spending an additional 1wp any time she would use a charm to apply it's effects to all combatants the battlegroup would hit.
