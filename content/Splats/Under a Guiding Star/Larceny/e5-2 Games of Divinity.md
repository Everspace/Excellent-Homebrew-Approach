The sidereal beckons a person to a wager. This wager must consist a person who is not the exalt fulfilling a destiny or task to which both parties agree to. Each party (the Sidereal and their victim) bets "anything" and thus the game begins.

The rules are as follows:

1. The parties must not kill or bring to harm the person selected for the task, wagers, or parties, or in any way hinder them from the performing the task.
2. The person must not know of the bet or the parties who wagered it.
3. Each party must give a boon to the person in addition to their wager.

The person who breaks any of these rules is subject to an automatic loss and immediate forfeit of their wager.

The exalt rolls (\[Social\] + \[Larceny\]) with a Target Number of 4 to convince the person to join in the game.

The Game of Divinity is irresistible to any being of essence. Demons, Spirits, Elementals, Gods all consider it targeting a Defining Intimacy. Regardless, no-one may call upon intimacies of temperance, or negative intimacies towards the sidereal or her compatriots to resist the proposal. No negative intimacy is generated from the proposal as it's just a silly bet about a simple matter. Resisting the suggestion requires 3 willpower.
