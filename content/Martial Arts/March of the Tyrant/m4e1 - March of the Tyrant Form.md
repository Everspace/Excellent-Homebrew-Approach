The stylist stands perfectly still, unnerving their fleeing quarry for a moment. The blood in their veins visibly burning red through their skin as a wide grin appears on their lips, their eyes projecting a hungry glare.

- The stylist gains non-charm dice to attacks based on the difference between their strength and the opponent's.
- The stylist gains 1 parry.
- Mobility Penalties are inverted, turning penalties into bonuses.

**Special Activation** When the stylist proves that they are physically stronger by successfully smashing (or similarly) a non-trivial opponent, or taking an attack without damage they may enter this form reflexively.
