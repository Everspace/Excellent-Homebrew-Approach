Rejigger the tree to be more acceptable to dips and the Craft Supernal. If you can Nine-Aeons Whew for 6 charms, you should be able to Dual Magnus Prana.

Charms that are missing have been removed, attempting to keep the most interesting bits together.

### General Rulings

- Charms that modify the creation rules of an artifact must be spent as the first roll is performed (Thousand Forge Hands).
- Charms that modify a singular craft must be payed per finishing roll.
- Failing or botching a craft does not prevent additional attempts at creating the particular artifact, but does behove you to start again and acquire a new set of materials and sorcerous reagents.
- A single stunt describing the craft process is applicable to the entire craft. The additional willpower is only applicable to the first roll performed.
- A great way to stunt is to describe the the hours laboured rubbing oils into the blade, or folding sunlight into the jade and oricalcum amalgam to surround a demon's tooth. Talk about the process of bringing a new wonder into the world, and the character's thoughts and feelings doing so.
- Craft charms will create non-charm dice and successes generally unless specifically said so otherwise.

## Power

<hr/>

Do the dice better.

- <book r="Flawless Handiwork Method"></book> Explode 10s, repurchase for exploding 6s.
- <book r="Supreme Masterwork Focus"></book> Double 6s, and repurchase and pay differently for 8s or 7s.

- **Second Word of the Demiurge**: 6m - Remove a run of 4 (like 2, 3, 4, 5) to make a non-charm 10
- **Final Word of the Demiurge**: Upgrade _Second Word of the Demiurge_ to allow a run of 3 (2, 3, 4) to make a non-charm 10.
- **Oricalcum Fervor**: 1wp - Use 3 un-used successes made so far to add a non-charm die.
- **Sacrosanct Delirium**: Upgrade to _Oricalcum Fervor_ to make it add 3 non-charm dice instead of 1.

### Additional Notes

- **Flawless Handiwork Method** and **Supreme Masterwork Focus** retain their repurchases, and effect the entire duration of the craft.

### How do I drive this thing

You roll the dice, and before the craft finishes, may spend motes and willpower to perform charms like the the various _Words of the Demiurge_ and _Oricalcum Fervor_ to attempt to garner additional successes.

Oricalcum Fervor mentions **used** and **unused** successes. An unused success is one that is like you had just rolled a success, and it has not been cited as a cost for a charm. Used charm dice are just successes that have been counted for effects like Oricalcum Fervor. If the number of used successes is greater than the number of unused successes, you are just unable to use these charms until enough unused successes are available.

The Words of the Demiurge charms involve removing dice from the dice pool. This means **physically picking them up so they are not there anymore**. Successes removed in this manner (typically 7, 8, 9, and 10s) are removed from the number of **unused successes** available.

### New Charms

#### First Word of the Demiurge

- Mins: Essence 1, Craft 3
- Type: Reflexive
- Cost: 6m

Any number of 3-of-a-kinds may be removed from the dice rolled to produce that many non-charm 10s.

A 3-of-a-kind is any set of 3 dice that display the same number like 3 different dice displaying 6. You may do as many at once as you desire, for example removing 3 dice displaying 6, and 9 dice displaying 1 to make 4 non-charm dice displaying 10.

Dice created with First Word of the Demiurge are subject to explosions from effects like Flawless Handiwork Method.

#### Second Word of the Demiurge

Todo

#### Final Word of the Demiurge

Todo

#### Oricalcum Fervor

- Mins: Essence 2, Craft 5
- Type: Reflexive
- Cost: 1wp
- Requires: Flawless Handiwork Method

You may use any number of unused successes to create new non-charm dice. For every 3 successes spent this way, create 1 non-charm die.
