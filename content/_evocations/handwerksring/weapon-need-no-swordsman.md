Attuned to its own creations, Handwerksring acts as a bridge between the weapon and it’s creator.

You may instead use an appropriate Craft skill when wielding a weapon of your own making instead of Archery, Brawl, Melee, or Throw. This roll is only compatible with the charms and evocations of the original roll.

For example, while brandishing a spear, you may roll (Dexterity + Craft[Weaponsmithing]).

You are also always considered resonant with the weapon’s materials while wielding it.
