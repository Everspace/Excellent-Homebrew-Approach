For every 9 you roll on a non-attack roll involving Strength to demonstrate superior athleticism you gain 1m, and for every 10, you gain 2m. These motes may be used to offset the cost of this artifacts evocations and Athletics charms for the rest of the scene, or you may also use these motes to retroactively to lower the cost of applicable committed charms and charms used in the demonstration, returning the discounted motes to the Solar's mote pool.
