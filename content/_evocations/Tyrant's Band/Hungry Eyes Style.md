Nothing can stop a hungry lizard from their next meal, and the warer adopts a similar hungry look in their eye.

The bearer selects a being that she is aware of as a target of their hunger and for the rest of the scene she rerolls:

* 3 failures on all combat rolls to attack, pursue, or contest the escape of her prey.
* 2 failures on all attack rolls, feats of strength, and threaten actions against the snacks and obstacles in the way.

Difficult terrain never impedes her from moving towards the offender, nor does anything less than full cover provide any beneft to them against her attacks.

**Special Activation:** atunement blah blah blah
