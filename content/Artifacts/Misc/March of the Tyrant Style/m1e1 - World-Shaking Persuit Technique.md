Explosive speed unheard of from a creature so massive, the Tyrant moves forwards ready to crush all in its path.

This removes the penalty for flurrying a Rush action with an attack. If the user succeeds on their rush action, their weapon gains the smashing tag, and may use it without paying the costs for doing so.

Repeated use of this charm adds 1 die to both the raw damage of the attack and to the rush roll which stacks to a max of (Strength) bonus dice.

**Terrestrial:** The stacking damage and dice on this charm only apply when used repeatedly against the same target.
