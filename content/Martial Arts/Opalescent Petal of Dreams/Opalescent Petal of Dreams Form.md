When the Sidereal enters into the form, the battlefield transformed into a garden of gently falling petals of soft hues in the colours of the 5 Maidens. They stand with the grace of someone strolling daintily through a garden, and stand with a calm, withdrawn posture just beyond your touch

The sidereal is considered at Short range to all her opponents and is treated as if they were under heavy cover if beset by projectiles. Her opponents are but an arms length away. She is everywhere, but beyond.

In order to catch the sidereal with an attack, the opponent must first attempt to rush to meet them before delivering the strike. Disengaging while in this form benefits from (Essnce) dice.

The stylist may reflexively enter this form when they successfully disengage from an opponent, or upon rolling join battle if they are in a garden or other serene and vegetative place.
