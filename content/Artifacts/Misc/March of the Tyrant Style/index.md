The Tyrant encourages massive weaponry and overwhelming force. It bowls over opponents and crushes them into the dust and mulches them into paste. The Tyrant is tireless in its pursuit of its prey and an unstoppable force. This style may be used with any Heavy weapon though its practitioners traditionally prefer the Greatsword and Grand Daiklave.

This style may be practiced in any armor.

The weight of your armour is a Tier.

**Armour Tier is treated as:**

- 1 for Light
- 2 for Medium
- 3 for Heavy
