Attuning to this artifact gives you the following effect:

For every 9 you roll on a check involving Strength to demonstrate superior athleticism you gain 1m, and for every 10, you gain 2m. These motes may be used to offset the cost of this artifacts evocations and Athletics charms for the rest of the scene, or you may also use these motes to retoroactively lower the cost of applicable committed charms, returning the discounted motes to the Solar's mote pool.
