None can look upon a Tyrant Lizard and not feel terror.

Upon a successful feat of strength, the Solar may reflexively make an intimidate with successes equal to the roll on the feat of strength.

In addition this changes Tiger's Dread Symmetry (Ex3 pg. 370) to provide 1 non-charm dice to all Presence rolls.
