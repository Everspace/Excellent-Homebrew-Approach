**Attunement:** 3m

Attuning to this artifact gives you the following effect:

For every 9 you roll on a non-attack roll involving Strength to demonstrate superior athleticism you gain 1m, and for every 10, you gain 2m. These motes may __only__ be used to offset the cost of this artifacts evocations and Athletics charms for the rest of the scene. These motes may also be used to retroactively on any charm used during the scene relating to the feat, returning the discounted motes to the wearer's mote pool.
