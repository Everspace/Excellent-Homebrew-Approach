Still Star, the Sage of 8 Colours, Wishforger of the first age is trapped.

Long long ago, after a trick of a fae lord he was cursed to never step foot upon creation again. Manifesting his destiny, allows him a solice of living and making within a workshop beyond the horizon.

# A man of Iron

Still Star is a large man. Standing at almost 9ft and looking almost as wide as he is tall, he is seemingly larger than life like any solar from the first age might.

Dispite skin of iron, and terrifying visage, he radiates a pleasant warmth like the sun, and a sincere smile behind his stumbled words. Star wishes for not except the improvement of creation, and uses his skills to make the world in his mind, a better place. Wearing his heart on his sleeve, it is easy to see what is turning in his head.

And a vast machine that is.

## Rules

## Plans

Still Star has been planning for his nigh 6000 year imprisonment on what he's going to do once he brakes his curse, and can set foot upon creation once again. Not unlike a train, he will proceed to immediately attempt to restore what had been lost of the first age, travelling to the largest oldest city near where he emerges to begin what is essentially reforging creation.

Still Star can be responsible for pretty much any oddball wonder within creation. With perfect knowledge of his creations and his charm _Final Word of the Demiurge_, he could command and pilot any first age monstrosity at a whim.

Example senarios could be:

## The South

Still Star bemones the state of Chiaroscuro, and feels the presence of the Rod of Dominion within Paragon. Upon arriving, he walks and looks directly at a tatoo which bares his symbol, says hello and "I would like to talk to you" with a visage of "I'm here for my stuff" plain on his face. Bemused the Perfect forcibly detunes the prefect

# Sage of 8 Colours

Star is a master of all
