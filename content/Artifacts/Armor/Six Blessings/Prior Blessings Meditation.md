The movements of creation (and the things inside) fill everything with essence. Your prayers filled the beads, and now you empty them to begin anew.

Refill your mote pool, and regain your willpower as if you never acted at all, rolling join battle once again.

You may use this charm if able as a scene ends if all 6 beads are lit up (rolling join battle if it amuses you).
