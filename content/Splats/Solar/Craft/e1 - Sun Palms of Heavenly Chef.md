The Solar uplifts her ingredients to their full potential. While preparing a meal, the solar's essence cleanses away any mundane contamination such as dirt and parasites, and enhances it's flavour and texture. Anything remotely considered food is treated as an Excellent Tool, and in addition grants a further (Essence) non-charm dice.

When consumed, the food also functions as an inspire action for an emotion determined at the time of crafting. This is an inspire action with a number of dice equal to the extra successes on a craft for a minor project, or in the case of a major or superior project, the highest number of extra successes number on any roll for the project.
