With a moment of concentration, the Solar may banish a thing they have made or own that they can hold in their hands elsewhere.

This may not be a weapon or protective armour.

Up to 3 items may be kept elsewhere per mote committed, with a minimum of 1.

This charm covers covers things like Winterbreath jars and Boots, Cloaks or Belts, to materials like a sphere of oricalcum, a nice piece of wood, or a delicious cake.

The solar may reflexively summon any of the items held elsewhere, and may only uncommit the mote after enough items have been removed. This does allow you to change what is kept elsewhere.
