Each bead is a prayer, and every prayer a blessing confirred. Venus and Mercury share a kindred spirit toward movement for a continued creation.

When you first light the bead of **Adventure** or **Joy** and whenever you would light them again, gain a protective pool of 2i that must be drained before any excess damage spills over to the barer of Six Blessings.

When you have 3 beads lit, the protective pool increases to 4i.

When you have 6 beads lit, this applies to any action that would light any bead.
