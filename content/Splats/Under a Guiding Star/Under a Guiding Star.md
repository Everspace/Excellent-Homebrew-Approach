## A portent

A sidereal doesn't exalt in the heat of a moment. They receive a portent of their destiny in a symbol, motion, or subtle idea. Upon realizing what that means, and the gravity that accompanies this, the Sidereal exalts, blossoming in a bloom of colour while leaving creation behind.

## Arcane Fate

Long long ago, the Sidereals gathered together and wove fate for the continuation of creation. The immense stress of the action of removing the Solars from creation, and hiding themselves to do so broke and irrevocably shattered the constellation of the Mask.

The Mask governs secret wisdom and by it's breaking the Sidereals are all hidden by fate itself as a secret forevermore.

All traces of Sidereals are eventually forgotten, and the memory of them slips away like a scent upon the breeze, or the sand away to the ocean. Records of their existance are easily misplaced or destroyed.

There is however still hope for those that wish to be connected to creation. The destinies they weave with others, and the bonds that are never able to be forgotten are their hope and salvation.

An intimacy relating to a Sidereal decays at alarming rates, and unless they are within constant contact, their memory slips away to nothing but a shape or a feeling. An intimacy towards a Sidereal decays at the ending of a scene in which they are not present, unless they are part of a circle or other tightknit group adventuring together. First from Major to Minor, then from minor to nothingness. A defining intimacy can never be eroded this way, for even the mask cannot break apart the strings of love or hate so pure that bind two beings together. Any being may attempt to resist this erosion with a (Wits + Integrity) roll vs. a difficulty of (9 - intimacy eroding).

Finding a Sidreal is tricky even before they try to hide from those that wish to find them! Attempting to locate a Sidereal or determine the result of any action they've taken from record or by second hand account is a (\[Mental\] + \[Ability\]) roll vs. a difficulty (5 + scenes since action).

A sidereal gets by day to day via a loophole. A woven tapestry of archtype called a **Resplendent Destiny**

## Resplendent Destinies

## The Sidereal Sway

The stars guide the sidereals between their passions and their duty to creation and their own destiny and each sidereal finds a particular constellation that calls to them. This is called a sway.

When all else is wrong, or when the sidereal is feeling lost, alone, or misguided, the constellation that they look to to help them is the one they feel the most attachment to. When a sidereal is at their best, the excibit the ascending qualities of that constellation. This could be passionate, wise, fun, or even surefooted and daring. When at their worst, the decending qualities of their guiding stars shine through. The sidereal is aloof, cold, or uncaring, prone to vice, or easily distracted.

The sway a sidereal is limited to constellations in their house, or "caste".

The sidereal Sway allows them to learn charms up to essence 3 without requiring them to obtain that essence beforehand. Their essence is also treated as the higher of (essence or 3) when a charm references that effect, and is able to lower the target number of a roll of that ability to 4 from essence 1.

A sway also provides them with a free **resplendent destiny** that reflects the sway they may experience without it counting against their maximum wherever they go.

A sidereal under the sway of the Gauntlet (Brawl) may learn **Sidereal Martial Arts** at essence 1 if they wish.

## Peerless martial artists

All sidereals find the motions and patterns of martial arts agreeable to their essence, since they echo the strange movements of creation much like the stars' dancing. A sidereal martial artist may learn charms as if their essence was 1 higher than it was.

A sidereal may buy a martial art at the favoured cost with _Sidereal experience_, and also may spend only 5 _normal experience_ to acquire one with.

All the charms of a martial art gains the benefit of **mastery** on all the charms of that martial art.

## Sutras

Unlike their peers, the Sidereals and their mentors (The Maidens) are in more direct communication than most would be. Their closeness is

A sutra is typically an otherwise ordinary slip of paper inscribed with the judicious prayer of the exalted for guidance of their patron.
