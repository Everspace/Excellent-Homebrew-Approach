This set of 2 bracelets, 2 anklets, and 1 necklace, are a collection of slivers of mighty oaks encased in a crystal like substance forming beads. They are strung together with a silken thread and tighten to a snug but comfortable fit when worn.

When they are slipped on, each loop weighs up to as much as any great tree found near the pole of wood. The user may decide they are just fashionable, or are exactly as challenging to train or move around in with as they wish. Attuning to them for 1 mote makes the users feet dense and heavy, and they are almost impossible to knock down or shove without a Feat of Strength of difficulty 7, or a similar number of excessive successes in the case of charms like Heaven Thunder Hammer.

If the user commits 3m while attuned, the Weights may be forcibly put on a victim as a difficulty 3 gambit, or automatically if you are in control of a grapple and relinquish it. This knocks them prone for (essence + 3) rounds in combat or that many hours outside of combat.

The victim is pinned with the weight of many trees that require a difficulty 10 feat of strength to get up, or displace the person in question. An ally may slip the beads off easily with a simple action, but it is nigh impossible to do so personally.
