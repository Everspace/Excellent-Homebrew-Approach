With the strength of thousand dragon kings, the lawgiver brings their weapon down with a resounding crash.

On a successful withering attack this evocation adds 3 dice to the post-soak damage of the attack, potentially increasing the minimum damage.

On a successful decisive attack, it allows up to 3 extra successes from the attack roll to become raw damage of the blow.
